The recommended way to install the package is through the cmd:

sudo dpkg -i walabot-maker.deb


The package installs the following files/paths:

/usr/lib/libWalabotAPI.so  - The walabot library.
/usr/include/WalabotAPI.h  - The walabot library header file.
/var/lib/walabot/...       - The walabot database and configuration files. Give this path to Walabot_SetSettingsFolder.
/usr/share/doc/walabot/... - Example code, licence and README.
/usr/share/walabot/python/ - Python module wrapping Walabot API.
/etc/udev/rules.d/...      - Special udev rule for walabot device, so it could be access without root priviliges.
/usr/bin/walabot-diagnose  - Walabot diagnose utility for support (if needed).

How to use the example code:

Copy examples folder to a writable workarea and run buildAll.sh script:

cp /usr/share/doc/walabot/examples/* .
chmod +x *.sh
./buildAll.sh

That will build all the examples into binaries which you can run (Of course, don't forget to connect the Walabot device before running them!)

Note: If you have older g++ version, you will probably have to edit the buildAll.sh script to add c++11 support.
